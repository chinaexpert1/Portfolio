3) I really struggled with this one! There were many things I thought I understood but didn't.
   I got a jump on the assignment, so I started out with the Linux input file, and it took me 5 hours
   to get rid of the Byte Order Mark. It was a simple keyword, of course, but it took a byte out of me!
   But seriously, I wanted to cover all the bases with this assignment and I tried my best. I could not
   get the polymorphism to work with the child classes, I got a circular import everytime I tried to
   refer to them from qoperators.py - but I solved it the best way I can in main.py, they way I understood.
   My approach for the exam was to build out what was required first, then what was obvious next,
   and fill in the rest as subtasks to piece it together. I always use the sample output as a guide to see
   if the program is successfull, and ultimately, finished, because that's what the user sees.
   I went in order down the instructions sheet. In particular I envisioned the data flow and built a tracer
   through each module so I could get some print statements right off the bat. I got stuck here and there, 
   and I consulted about 100 web pages. I think I met all the requirements. It has been a pleasure taking 
   this class and I hope to see Joe and Alan (and Vanessa!) in the future in an advanced course.
4) a) prob_amplitudes() is implemented but never used. It wasn't clear to me how to from the instructions
      and the sample output. Joe said to "demonstrate" the results were equivalent, but the sample output
      didn't show that so I didn't either. I achieved the sample output without it, and checked with print()
      along the way. Due to the slight variation of the random.binomial() sample, I thought an extra
      equivalence statement inappropriate.
   b) Checking manually, the results for Qubit #5 match the prob_amplitudes() but not Joe's output.
      He said there could be some variation. Otherwise, my output is the same.
