3) My approach for this assignment was to model the mathematics with a diagram to understand the flow of the program.
   First, I coded up the pieces that were mandated by the instructions, like the main() function section, to make sure
   my program fit requirements. Then I worked out a base case and a recursive case for each algorithm. I got stuck.
   I had to refer to online explanations of the mathematics. I also couldn't get my output exactly like Joe's. I am
   getting wider line spacing for some reason.
4) No known bugs.
