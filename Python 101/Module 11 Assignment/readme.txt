3) For this assignment I read the directions carefully to get an overview of the problem.
   Once I knew what the code was supposed to be doing, I worked on the required and recommended
   parts of the program, including the functions suggested. Fleshing out these functions was
   enough to complete most of the program once functionality was added. I did them in order,
   adding copious print statements along the way to make sure the program was handling values
   correctly. A lot of print statements were required, but I figured out the formatting issues,
   (converting floats to int for example) and did some math to get the right operations on the
   encoded vectors. After the inputs and functions were done, I tied them together in a main()
   function and fiddled with it until it was raising the right exceptions and giving the right output
   otherwise. Joe and Alan said their solution was 130 lines, and mine came out to be 138 with
   a title and whitespace included, so I think I did a good job. I've used Jupyter notebooks before,
   but I decided not to use it on this project. I definitely will in the future to relay results.

4) There are two known bugs, but Alan has excused one of them. The data type is printing out for my arrays.
   He was not concerned about it. However, upon looking at my code, he said it looked like
   I was making row vectors not column vectors. However, I am mystified, and I can't correct the
   problem because I don't see what he means. The example is help. It is coverted into he and lp.
   My code does this. It groups consecutive letters into two elements arrays. When an array only has
   two elements, do I reshape it? My output looks the same as the sample output. 
   I don't see what he means and I've run out of time. Please understand.
