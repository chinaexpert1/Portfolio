3) I tried so hard for 11 hours and I just couldn't get my code working. It works up until the point where I need to check if any patients have switched clusters, and update the means.
   There were multiple questions I had on the approach. How to clear the interior of a list of lists, and not the whole list? How come my for loop miscalculates the centroids?
   I tried to follow the psuedocode to the fullest extend to organize my program, but an error in the psuedocode set me back hours. Joe clarified via email that the patients data structure
   is meant to be a NESTED data structure, a list of pairs, as in a list of lists, and not an UNNESTED data structure, as in a vanilla list. I tried to make this work with a vanilla list.
   Please ask Joe if I can get some points back. As it stands, the program is far from completion, and I lack understanding of some basic tasks such as updating lists, and keeping track of the flow of values.
   One thing I must say, is there was very little coverage of "generic" code in the reading, lectures or office hours, and File I/O was a very small part of the assignment.
4) The program doesn't work. I left it in a state where it prints out the centroids, but they are incorrect values. The only working code is the initial data structures,
   Euclidean distance, and append to clusters, once. I couldn't clear lists of lists.
5) a. I think Joe's solution at only 7 iterations is very efficient so I don't understand. To improve on that code, you would have to improve upon the k means algortihm as
      explained in the assignment. The explanation is that it proceeds from random centroids, to clusters, to a new mean for each centroid, to new clusters and so on until stability.  
   b. I also don't understand this question because according to the definition of the algorithm any convergence is a legitimate solution. 
      I don't understand what "converge too early" means.
