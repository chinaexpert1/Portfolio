1) Andrew Taylor  atayl136
2) Module 4 Data Structures, N Body Simulation
3) This assignment was tough to conceive of for the physics, but coded up easier than expected.
I still don't understand why the formulas work without the Sun at the origin, but they work that way.
I guess Newton was thinking from the planets perspective, not the Sun's and that was the secret.
At any rate, to solve the assignment I had to follow the instructions very closely because of this
confusion. I started by reading the instructions, copying over the initial inputs as directed,
and setting up my program with the pseudocode as a template. I tried to work from the data up,
arriving at nested loops from clues like "SUN = 3" and then I turned to formatting the output,
because it made sense to pass the initial list right through some tracer code to get that right
first. That would leave me more time to focus on the calculations by not leaving that for the end.
I had to try the calculations out both ways, several times, before understanding that the diagram
and the directions in the instructions were strictly correct. I used the dt timestep as it was and it
worked, but it was not working when I tried to count the timesteps and use that as a variable.
After finishing off the program in places where the pseudocode did not speak, I commented.
I got the right output.
4) No known bugs.
