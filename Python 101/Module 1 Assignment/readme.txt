3) My approach was to follow the instructions closely, even when I thought there was room for interpretation. I used the concepts presented in the lecture, such as variables, data types like strings and integers, and the function print. I looked up how to convert an integer to a string and I used the str() function. Then I printed the results from the input functions by referencing the corresponding variables in the print function, preceded by the prompt.
4) No known bugs.
