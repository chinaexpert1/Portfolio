3) For this assignment I proceeded in a linear fashion through the requirements. I produced the desired results, for both algorithms, but in part 1 I used two loops instead of one. I was unable to think of how to combine them. The resulting code is twice as long as Joe's solution, he said.
4) No known bugs.
