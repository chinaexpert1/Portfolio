3) For this program, I did what I always do which is start with any mandated part of the solution.
   This ensures I will deliver a project that meets the requirements. As such, I tackled the defined function first.
   After I got that working, which required file I/O and data structures, I moved through the rest of the task.
   I realized that I would have two dictionaries at this point, so I inverted the freq to match values to keys, and
   then created a cipher by putting through the keys of the function result to new values. Now I had letters to letters.
   After this I spent some time figuring out how to replace the ciphertext with new letters from the cipher.
   As Joe said, the result was a legible sentence with just ambiguity at the redundant entries.
   I corrected the message by hand, checked the hash, and was done.
4) No known bugs.
