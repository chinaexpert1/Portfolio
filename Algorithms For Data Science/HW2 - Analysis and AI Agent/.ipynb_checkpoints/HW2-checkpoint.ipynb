A game like rock paper scissors is typically played between two players and has a clearly defined set of rules for a win, draw, and loss. Since it is impossible (acknowledging that studies have been preformed to use behavior to attempt a prediction - but we will ignore that for the purpose of this exercise) to predict an opponent's move, we will assume that the user will input a value, the computer will see this input then choose from a set of rules the correct response play, acting as a simple goal based agent.<br>\n",
